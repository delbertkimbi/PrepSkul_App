# PrepSkul: Notifications, Activity & Flow (Detailed)

This document maps **who receives what notifications**, **when**, and **what action triggers them**, from onboarding through booking, payment, and attending sessions. It covers **Admin**, **Tutors**, and **Students/Parents**.

---

## How notifications are delivered

| Channel | When used | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **In-app** | Always | Stored in Supabase `notifications`; visible in app bell and notification list. Real-time via Supabase Realtime. |
| **Push (FCM)** | When API available | Sent via Next.js API (Firebase Admin SDK). Android/iOS/Web. |
| **Email** | When API available | Sent via Next.js API (Resend). Controlled per notification by `sendEmail`. |

Flow: **In-app is always created first**; then API is called for push + email (fails silently if API is down).

**Trigger:** `NotificationHelperService.notifyAbandonedBookingReminder`.

---

## 10. QUICK REFERENCE: WHEN A TUTOR IS BOOKED

**Recurring booking:**  
1. **Tutor** gets `booking_request` when student/parent creates the request.  
2. When tutor **accepts**, **student/parent** gets `booking_approved` (with Pay Now link if payment request created).  
3. When student **pays**, **tutor** gets `payment_received` and **both** get `sessions_created`.  
4. **Tutor** can also get `session_ready` (e.g. after trial payment) and `earnings_added` when earnings are recorded.

**Trial booking:**  
1. **Tutor** gets `trial_request` when student/parent requests a trial.  
2. When tutor **accepts**, **student/parent** gets `trial_accepted` (Pay Now).  
3. When student **pays**, **tutor** gets `trial_payment_received` and `session_ready`; **student** gets `trial_payment_completed`.  
4. Session reminders (24h, 1h, 15min) are scheduled for **both**; **session_started** goes to the other party when one joins.

So **yes: when a tutor is booked (recurring or trial), they receive notifications** at request, acceptance, payment, session creation, and session reminders/start/completion as above.

---

## Summary table by role

| Role | Notification types (examples) |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Admin** | New user signup, survey completed, new tutor request, payout request (log/in-app). |
| **Tutor** | Onboarding reminder; booking/trial request; trial accepted/cancelled/updated/modified; payment received; session ready; sessions created; session reminders; session started; earnings added; profile approved/improvement/rejected; modification request; payout status. |
| **Student/Parent** | Booking approved/rejected; trial accepted/rejected; payment confirmed/failed; sessions created; payment reminders; session reminders; session started; session completed; feedback/review reminder; low credits; tutor request matched; modification accepted; abandoned booking reminder. |

All of the above are implemented in `notification_helper_service.dart` (and some in `notification_service.dart` or `session_lifecycle_service.dart`). In-app notifications are always created; push and email depend on the API and per-notification flags.

---

## Limiting factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **API dependency for push/email** | Push (FCM) and email are sent via Next.js API. If the API is down or unreachable, only in-app notifications are created. Users get no push/email until they open the app. |
| **Scheduled reminders** | Session reminders (24h, 1h, 15min), payment reminders (2 days, 1 day, 2 hours), feedback/review reminders are scheduled via API. If the API call fails, fallback only logs; no server-side cron means reminders may not fire. |
| **FCM token** | Push requires a valid FCM token stored in `fcm_tokens`. Web needs a service worker; iOS needs APNS. Simulators or missing permission = no push. |
| **Email deliverability** | Email goes through Resend via API. Rate limits, spam filters, or misconfiguration can block or delay delivery. |
| **Single channel emphasis** | In-app is the only guaranteed channel. Users who don’t open the app won’t see anything unless push/email succeeded. |
| **No retry for API send** | If `_sendNotificationViaAPI` fails (network/timeout), we don’t retry. Push/email for that event are lost. |
| **Admin payout notification** | Payout request from tutor currently logs only; no in-app notification to admins unless extended. |

---

## Engagement notifications (2025 orchestrator)

Server-side campaigns run on **cron-job.org** (see `PrepSkul_Web/docs/CRON_JOB_REGISTRY.md`). Rules:

- **At most one** engagement push per user per calendar day (WAT) if they had **no meaningful activity** that day (`last_seen`, session, SkulMate, booking/payment/message).
- Copy is **role-safe** and uses subjects/goals where available.
- Channels: push + in-app only (no engagement email). Users can disable via **Learning tips & reminders** (`engagement_push_enabled`).

Types include: `daily_inactivity_nudge`, `monday_engagement`, `monthly_engagement`, `calendar_engagement`, `behaviour_tutor_browse`, `daily_challenge_reminder`. Tap routing: `notification_navigation_service.dart`.

Full design: `PrepSkul_Web/docs/NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md`.

**Gaps addressed:** session lifecycle uses `NotificationHelperService` for completed/cancelled/no-show; `schedule-review-reminder` API exists; schedule-* routes use admin client.

---

## How notifications can be improved

1. **Reduce API dependency**  
   - Option A: Use Supabase Edge Functions or a background job to send push/email from DB (e.g. poll `notifications` or use pg_notify).  
   - Option B: Store “pending push/email” in DB and have a worker/API retry with backoff.

2. **Reliable scheduling**  
   - Move reminder scheduling to a backend (Supabase cron, Edge Function on schedule, or external scheduler) that reads “session start” / “payment due” and creates notifications at the right time.  
   - Keep client call only to “register that reminders are needed”; actual send at 24h/1h/15min (or 2d/1d/2h) server-side.

3. **Retry and observability**  
   - Retry failed API calls (with backoff) for push/email.  
   - Log failures to a table or monitoring; alert on high failure rate.

4. **FCM and permissions**  
   - Ensure token is refreshed and stored after permission grant; re-prompt on iOS if previously denied.  
   - On web, document/service-worker setup for FCM.

5. **Admin payout alerts**  
   - Create in-app (and optional push/email) notifications to admins when a tutor requests payout, using the same pattern as other admin notifications.

6. **User preferences**  
   - Use notification preferences (already have `notification_preferences_screen`) to gate email/push per type so we don’t send unwanted channels.

7. **Deep links and action URLs**  
   - Ensure all `actionUrl` values are handled by app_links/deep linking so tapping a notification opens the right screen (e.g. `/bookings/requests/:id`, `/trials/:id`).
