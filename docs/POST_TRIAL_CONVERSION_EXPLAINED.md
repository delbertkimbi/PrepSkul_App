# Post-Trial Conversion Screen - Explained

## What It Is

The **Post-Trial Conversion Screen** is **NOT a messaging feature**. It's a **booking flow** that allows students/parents to convert their completed trial session into a regular recurring booking.

---

## The Flow

### Scenario:
1. **Student books a trial session** with a tutor (e.g., 1-hour trial for Mathematics)
2. **Tutor approves** the trial
3. **Student pays** for the trial (via Fapshi)
4. **Trial session happens** (via Google Meet, monitored by Fathom AI)
5. **Trial session ends** - Student liked the tutor and wants to continue

### What Happens Next:

**The student can now convert the trial into a regular booking:**

```
Trial Session Completed
         ↓
Student sees "Convert to Regular Booking" option
         ↓
Opens Post-Trial Conversion Screen
         ↓
4-Step Wizard:
  1. Select frequency (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x per week)
  2. Select days (Monday, Wednesday, etc.)
  3. Select location (online, onsite, hybrid)
  4. Review & select payment plan
         ↓
Creates a Booking Request
         ↓
Tutor receives booking request (same as regular booking)
         ↓
Tutor approves/rejects
         ↓
If approved → Recurring session created
```

## Who Is Talking to Who?

**NO ONE IS TALKING!** This is not a chat/messaging feature.

### What Actually Happens:

1. **Student/Parent** → **System** → **Tutor**
   - Student fills out the conversion form
   - System creates a **booking request** (same as regular booking)
   - Tutor receives a **notification** about the new booking request
   - Tutor can **approve or reject** in their dashboard

2. **It's the Same Flow as Regular Booking:**
   - Student wants to book tutor → Creates booking request
   - Tutor sees request → Approves or rejects
   - If approved → Recurring sessions start

---

## Why Is It Called "Conversion"?

Because it **converts** a one-time trial session into an ongoing recurring booking arrangement.

**Before Conversion:**
- ✅ Trial session completed
- ❌ No ongoing sessions scheduled

**After Conversion:**
- ✅ Trial session completed
- ✅ Regular recurring sessions scheduled (e.g., 2x per week)
- ✅ Monthly payment plan set up

---

## What Data Is Pre-filled?

The conversion screen **pre-fills** data from the trial session to make it easier:

- **Subject** - Same as trial (e.g., "Mathematics")
- **Location** - Same as trial (e.g., "online")
- **Day & Time** - Same as trial (e.g., "Monday at 4:00 PM")
- **Tutor** - Same tutor from trial

**Student can modify:**
- Frequency (how many times per week)
- Days (can add more days)
- Times (can adjust)
- Location (can change)
- Payment plan (monthly, biweekly, weekly)

## Example Flow

### Trial Session:
- **Date:** Monday, Jan 25, 2025
- **Time:** 4:00 PM
- **Subject:** Mathematics
- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Location:** Online
- **Tutor:** John Doe

### After Trial (Student wants to continue):

**Student opens conversion screen:**

**Step 1: Frequency**
- Student selects: **2x per week**

**Step 2: Days**
- Pre-filled: **Monday** (from trial)
- Student adds: **Wednesday**
- Times: Monday 4:00 PM, Wednesday 4:00 PM

**Step 3: Location**
- Pre-filled: **Online** (from trial)
- Student keeps it as online

**Step 4: Review & Payment**
- Monthly total: 24,000 XAF (2x/week × 4 weeks × 3,000 XAF/session)
- Student selects: **Monthly payment plan**

**Result:**
- Booking request created
- Tutor receives notification
- Tutor approves
- Recurring sessions start: Every Monday & Wednesday at 4:00 PM

## Is This Messaging?

**NO!** This is a **booking request system**, not messaging.

### Messaging Would Be:
```
Student: "Hi, I'd like to book you for regular sessions"
Tutor: "Sure! What days work for you?"
Student: "Monday and Wednesday"
Tutor: "Perfect! I'll set that up"
```

### What We Actually Have:
```
Student: [Fills out conversion form]
System: [Creates booking request]
Tutor: [Sees request in dashboard, approves/rejects]
System: [If approved, creates recurring sessions]
```

**No back-and-forth conversation** - it's a structured booking request that the tutor can approve or reject.

## Where Does This Screen Appear?

The conversion screen appears **after a trial session is completed**:

1. **Trial session ends**
2. **Fathom generates summary**
3. **Student receives notification:** "Trial session completed! Convert to regular booking?"
4. **Student taps notification** → Opens conversion screen
5. **Student fills form** → Creates booking request
6. **Tutor approves** → Recurring sessions start

---

## Summary

- ✅ **Booking flow** - Not messaging
- ✅ **Pre-fills trial data** - Makes conversion easy
- ✅ **Creates booking request** - Same as regular booking
- ✅ **Tutor approves/rejects** - Standard booking workflow
- ✅ **No chat involved** - Structured form submission

**Think of it as:** "I tried this tutor, I liked them, now I want to book them regularly" → Fill form → Request sent → Tutor approves → Done!
