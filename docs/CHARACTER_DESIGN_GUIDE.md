### Design Style Recommendations

**Recommended: 2D Flat Design**
- **Why**: Easier to create, maintain, and scale
- **Style**: Modern flat illustration (like Duolingo's Duo)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 512x512px minimum (square format)
- **Color**: Bright, friendly, age-appropriate colors

**Alternative: 2D Vector**
- Scalable without quality loss
- Easier to animate
- Can use SVG format

**Not Recommended: 3D**
- More complex to create
- Harder to maintain consistency
- Larger file sizes
- More difficult to animate

### How to Create Characters

#### Option 1: AI-Generated Characters (Fastest)
**Tools:**
- **Midjourney** / **DALL-E** / **Stable Diffusion**
- **Prompt example**: "Friendly 2D cartoon character, 8-year-old Cameroonian boy, school uniform, bright colors, flat design, transparent background, 512x512"

**Advantages:**
- Fast generation
- Multiple variations
- Professional quality

**Disadvantages:**
- May need refinement
- Consistency across characters

#### Option 2: Design Tools (Most Control)
**Tools:**
- **Figma** (Free, web-based)
- **Adobe Illustrator** (Professional)
- **Canva** (Easy, templates available)
- **Procreate** (iPad, hand-drawn)

**Advantages:**
- Full creative control
- Consistent style
- Easy to modify

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires design skills
- More time-consuming

#### Option 3: Hire a Designer
**Platforms:**
- Fiverr
- Upwork
- 99designs
- Local Cameroonian designers

**Advantages:**

- Culturally appropriate
- Consistent style

**Disadvantages:**

## Better Approaches

### 1. Use Character Illustration Libraries
- **Humaaans** (https://www.humaaans.com/) - Mix and match characters
- **Open Peeps** (https://www.openpeeps.com/) - Hand-drawn style
- **Blush** (https://blush.design/) - Customizable illustrations

### 2. AI Character Generators
- **Character.AI** - Generate consistent characters
- **Artbreeder** - Mix and match features
- **This Person Does Not Exist** - Realistic characters (not recommended for games)

### 3. Template-Based Design
- Use Figma templates
- Modify existing character designs
- Maintain consistency easily

## Implementation Notes

The code is ready - just add the images:
1. Create/obtain character images
2. Save to `assets/characters/` folder
3. Name files exactly as specified:
   - `elementary_male.png`
   - `elementary_female.png`
   - `middle_male.png`
   - `middle_female.png`
   - `high_male.png`
   - `high_female.png`
4. The app will automatically use them

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on design style** (2D flat recommended)
2. **Create or commission designs**
3. **Add images to assets folder**
4. **Test in app** - Characters will appear automatically
