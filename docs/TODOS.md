## 📌 **PLANNED: Tutor Video, Booking Flow & Onsite Session Improvements**

*(From plan: tutor video + booking flow UX; ONSITE_SESSION_TRACKING_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md)*

### Tutor video & booking flow
- [ ] **Tutor video:** Single-click play (no double-click); show YouTube controls; visible pause/play
- [ ] **Tutor video:** Loading state with thumbnail (no black screen)
- [ ] **Booking:** Child/learner selection **before** frequency (sessions per week) for all parents; adapt frequency/pricing by number of learners selected
- [ ] **Booking:** "Me (Parent)" option last in "Who is this for?" list
- [ ] **Booking:** Continue button state updates when selections change
- [ ] **Booking:** Payment/review screen visible for at least 1–2 s before transition

### Onsite session tracking improvements (Phase 1–5)
- [ ] **Phase 1 – Continuous location monitoring:** Create ContinuousLocationMonitoringService; periodic location checks (5–10 min); deviation detection; location history in DB; UI for location status
- [ ] **Phase 2 – Selfie verification:** Check-in group photo (tutor + student(s)); optional tutor face verification vs profile; face/photo UI at check-in only
- [ ] **Phase 3 – Activity verification:** SessionActivityVerificationService; activity submission UI; photo upload for work/whiteboard; notes/summary
- [ ] **Phase 4 – Multi-learner tracking:** Check-in for multiple learners; group photo verification; per-learner tracking
- [ ] **Phase 5 – Safety monitoring:** SessionSafetyService enhancements; real-time location; panic button; emergency contacts; safety alerts
- [ ] **Migration 058:** Create and run `058_onsite_tracking_improvements.sql` (from ONSITE_SESSION_TRACKING_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md spec)
- [ ] **In-app tutor instructions:** Benefit-focused copy (keep app in background; don’t close; helps document session / smooth payment)
- [ ] **Feedback form:** Add "Did this session take place?" (Yes/No/Partially) for family; multi-learner "Which learners attended?"
