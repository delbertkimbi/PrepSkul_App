---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Email Confirmation Infinite Polling Loop
**Problem**: Endless "AuthSessionMissingException" errors in console when on email confirmation screen.

**Cause**: `_checkEmailConfirmation()` was calling `refreshSession()` without checking if a session existed first.

**Solution**:
- Added polling attempt limit (20 attempts = 100 seconds max)
- Check for `currentSession` before calling `refreshSession()`
- Better error handling and logging

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/features/auth/screens/email_confirmation_screen.dart`

---

### 2. ✅ Email Forgot Password Missing
**Problem**: Email login screen had TODO for forgot password functionality.

**Solution**:
- Created `ForgotPasswordEmailScreen`
- Added `sendPasswordResetEmail()` to `AuthService`
- Integrated with email login flow
- Brand-consistent UI with wave header

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/features/auth/screens/forgot_password_email_screen.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/features/auth/screens/email_login_screen.dart`
- `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`

---

### 3. ✅ Storage Upload Uint8List Error
**Problem**: "Uint8List can't be assigned to parameter type File" error.

**Cause**: Supabase storage doesn't support uploading `Uint8List` directly.

**Solution**:
- Use `File` type for all uploads
- Temporarily disabled web uploads with helpful error message
- Document upload UI redesigned with slider

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/core/services/storage_service.dart`
- `lib/features/tutor/screens/tutor_onboarding_screen.dart`

---

### 4. ✅ GitGuardian SMTP Warning
**Problem**: GitGuardian flagged SMTP credentials in commit 8e5f325.

**Investigation**: Checked commit history - NO actual credentials exposed.

**Result**: Only documentation placeholder text `[Your Hostinger email password]`

**Action**: Safe to ignore, GitGuardian was overly cautious.

---

### 5. ✅ Document Upload UI Redesign
**Problem**: User wanted upload UI similar to availability slider.

**Solution**:
- Horizontal slider tabs for document types
- One document shown at a time with large upload button
- Uploaded documents show green checkmark
- Professional card-based design matching availability UI

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/features/tutor/screens/tutor_onboarding_screen.dart`

---

## Known Issue: Invalid Login Credentials

**Problem**: User reports "Invalid login credentials" when trying to sign in with email.

**Possible Causes**:
1. User originally signed up with **phone OTP**, not email/password
2. Email account was created without a password
3. Email not confirmed in Supabase
4. Wrong email/password entered

**How to Verify**:
Check in Supabase Auth dashboard:
- Does user have `password_hash` set?
- Is user confirmed (`email_confirmed_at` not null)?
- What auth method was used to create the user?

**Solution**:
If user was created with phone auth:
1. Use "Forgot Password" flow to set a password
2. OR sign in with phone OTP instead
3. OR re-sign up with email auth method

---

## Action Required: Supabase Configuration

### Redirect URLs Not Configured

Email verification still needs redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard:

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cpzaxdfxbamdsshdgjyg
2. Navigate: **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
3. Add these URLs:
   - `https://operating-axis-420213.web.app`
   - `https://operating-axis-420213.web.app/#`
   - `io.supabase.prepskul://` (for mobile)
4. Save changes

**Without this**, email verification will fail with "requested path is invalid" error.
