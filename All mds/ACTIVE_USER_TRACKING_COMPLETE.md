## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open `/All mds/ADD_ACTIVE_USER_TRACKING.sql`
3. Copy and paste the entire content
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify success message

### Step 2: Test the Feature
1. Refresh your admin dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. You should see the new "Active Users" metric card
3. Click "View details →" or navigate to "Active Users" in the nav
4. Check that all metrics display (they'll be 0 if no users are active)

### Step 3: Update Flutter App (Optional)
To track user activity from the Flutter app, add this to your `SupabaseService`:

```dart
// Call this whenever a user interacts with the app
Future<void> updateLastSeen() async {
  final userId = supabase.auth.currentUser?.id;
  if (userId == null) return;
  
  await supabase
      .from('profiles')
      .update({'last_seen': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()})
      .eq('id', userId);
}
```

Call `updateLastSeen()` in:
- App initialization
- Every screen navigation
- Every major user action
- On a timer (every 2-3 minutes when app is in foreground)

## URLs
- **Dashboard:** `/admin`
- **Active Users:** `/admin/users/active`

## Performance Notes
- Indexes added for fast queries
- All queries use `count: 'exact', head: true` for efficiency
- User list limited to 50 most recent
- Page uses Server Components for real-time data

## What's Next?

The active user tracking is fully functional! You can now:

1. ✅ See who's online in real-time
2. ✅ Track daily/weekly active users
3. ✅ Monitor peak activity times
4. ✅ Identify user engagement patterns
