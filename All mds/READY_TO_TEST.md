## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Database First**: Run the SQL before testing Flutter app
2. **Admin Setup**: Create admin user once, reuse forever
3. **Sample Data**: Use provided JSON tutors for consistent testing
4. **Video Player**: Works best on real device (simulator might lag)
5. **Booking**: Currently saves to local state, backend coming soon

## 🐛 Known Issues (Not Critical)

- iOS build error (use Android/Web for now)
