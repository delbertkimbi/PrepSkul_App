  - Real-time error: "Please enter a valid 9-digit phone number"
  
- ✅ **Account Names**:
  - Minimum 3 characters
  - Error: "Name must be at least 3 characters"
  
- ✅ **Bank Details**:
  - Minimum 10 characters for completeness
  - Error: "Please provide complete bank details"

#### **Social Media Links:**
- ✅ **Platform-Specific Validation**:
  - Facebook → Must contain "facebook.com"
  - LinkedIn → Must contain "linkedin.com"
