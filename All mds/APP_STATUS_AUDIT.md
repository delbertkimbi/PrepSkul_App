## ❌ **WHAT DOESN'T WORK**

### **1. Navigation Flow** ❌
**Problem:** After completing survey, users land on ugly home screen with no way to:
- Access their profile
- Logout
- Navigate to other features
- Test other parts of the app

**Missing:**
- Bottom navigation bar
- Proper routing structure
- Profile/Settings screen

---

### **2. Document Uploads** ⚠️
**Status:** UI exists, but not connected to storage
- Tutor survey has document upload fields
- Storage service is ready
- Just needs integration

**File:** `lib/features/tutor/screens/tutor_onboarding_screen.dart` (lines ~2200-2400)

---

### **3. Profile Photos** ⚠️
**Status:** Storage works, but not integrated into user flows
- Storage service ready
- Image picker ready
- Not in auth/survey flows

---

### **4. Tutor Discovery** ❌
**Missing entirely:**
- Browse tutors screen
- Tutor list/cards
- Filters (subject, level, price, location)
- Search functionality
- Tutor detail page

---

### **5. Matching System** ❌
**Missing entirely:**
- Request tutor functionality
- Tutor requests inbox
- Accept/reject requests
- Active connections tracking

**Database tables needed:**
- `tutor_requests` (pending requests)
- `tutor_matches` (accepted connections)

---

### **6. Admin Panel** ❌
**Missing entirely:**
- Tutor verification screen
- Approve/reject tutors
- View submitted documents
- Add verification notes

**Database updates needed:**
- Add `verification_status` to tutor_profiles
- Add `admin_notes` field

---

### **7. WhatsApp Integration** ❌
**Missing entirely:**
- Connect button for matched users
- Pre-filled message templates
- URL launching

---

### **8. Profile Management** ❌
**Missing entirely:**
- View profile screen
- Edit profile/survey responses
- Upload/change avatar
- Logout functionality (except in dashboard)

---

### **9. My Tutors / My Students** ❌
**Missing entirely:**

- Parent: View tutors per child
- Tutor: View active students

---

## ⚠️ **WHAT NEEDS CORRECTION**

### **1. Home Screen** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current:** Ugly placeholder with house icon  
**File:** `lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Fix Needed:**
- Replace with proper dashboard routing
- Route to correct dashboard based on user type
- Should never be shown to users

---

### **2. Survey Data Saving** ⚠️
**Status:** Unknown if survey data actually saves to database
- UI works, data collected
- Auto-save claims to work
- Need to verify data reaches Supabase

**Test:** Complete survey → Check Supabase dashboard

---

### **3. Onboarding Screen Overflow** ⚠️
**Issue:** UI overflows on smaller screens
**File:** `lib/features/onboarding/screens/simple_onboarding_screen.dart`

**Fix:** Make responsive or scrollable

---

### **4. Storage Test Button** ⚠️
**Issue:** Orange test button in tutor dashboard (for dev only)
**File:** `lib/features/tutor/screens/tutor_dashboard.dart` (line ~135)

**Fix:** Remove before production

---

### **5. Navigation After Survey** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Flow:**
```
Survey Complete → /home (ugly screen) → STUCK
```

**Should Be:**
```
Survey Complete → Dashboard (role-specific) → Bottom Nav
```

**Files to Update:**
- `lib/features/tutor/screens/tutor_onboarding_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/profile/screens/student_survey.dart`
- `lib/features/profile/screens/parent_survey.dart`

---

### **6. Logout Accessibility** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current:** Only in dashboard AppBar (not obvious)  
**Needed:** Profile/Settings screen with clear logout button

---

### **7. Survey Completion Flag** ⚠️
**Issue:** May not be setting `survey_completed = true` in profiles table

**Check:** After survey, verify in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, user_type, survey_completed 
FROM profiles 
WHERE id = 'user_id';
```
