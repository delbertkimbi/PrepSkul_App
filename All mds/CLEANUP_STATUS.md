## 🚧 **RESTORATION NEEDED:**

I need to restore the following screens from your working version (before they were accidentally cleared):

1. `tutor_home_screen.dart`
2. `tutor_requests_screen.dart`
3. `tutor_students_screen.dart`
4. `profile_screen.dart`
5. `find_tutors_screen.dart`
6. `my_tutors_screen.dart`

**Problem:** These were placeholder/dashboard screens I created for you that had basic UI. 
They got cleared during the cleanup process.
