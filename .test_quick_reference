# Quick Test Reference

## ✅ WORKING: Use absolute path
flutter test /Users/user/Desktop/PrepSkul/prepskul_app/test/features/messaging/

## ✅ WORKING: Use test runner script
./run_tests.sh

## ❌ FAILS: Relative path from inside prepskul_app
flutter test test/features/messaging/  # This will fail with double path

## ✅ WORKING: From project root
cd /Users/user/Desktop/PrepSkul
cd prepskul_app && flutter test test/features/messaging/
