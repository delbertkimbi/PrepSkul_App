## Complete Supabase SMTP Configuration

### Step 1: Get Your Hostinger Email Details

1. Log in to **Hostinger hPanel**
2. Go to **Email** â†’ **Email Accounts** (or **Professional Email**)
3. Find your `info@prepskul.com` account
4. Click on **Settings** or **Configure Email**

You should see:
- **Email:** `info@prepskul.com`
- **Password:** The password you set when creating the email

### Step 2: Configure SMTP in Supabase

Go to **Supabase Dashboard** â†’ **Authentication** â†’ **Email Templates** â†’ **SMTP Settings**

**Click "Enable Custom SMTP"** and enter:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP Port: 587
Encryption: TLS/STARTTLS
Username: info@prepskul.com
Password: [your email account password]
Sender Name: PrepSkul
Reply-To: info@prepskul.com
```

### Step 3: Alternative Port (If 587 Doesn't Work)

If port 587 has issues, try SSL on port 465:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP Port: 465
Encryption: SSL
Username: info@prepskul.com
Password: [your email account password]
Sender Name: PrepSkul
Reply-To: info@prepskul.com
```

2. Go to **Email** â†’ **Email Accounts**
3. Click on your `info@prepskul.com` account
4. Click **Change Password** or **Reset Password**
5. Set a new secure password

## Testing Your Setup

After configuring SMTP:

1. In Supabase, click **"Send a test email"**
2. Enter your personal email address
3. Check if you receive the test email
4. Confirm the "From" name shows **"PrepSkul"** instead of "Supabase Auth"

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication Failed" Error

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong password
- Typo in username (should be `info@prepskul.com`)
- Wrong encryption setting

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check password in hPanel
2. Verify username is the **full email address**
3. Try TLS on port 587 first, then SSL on port 465

### "Connection Timeout" Error

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong SMTP host
- Firewall blocking port

**Solutions:**
1. Use `smtp.hostinger.com` (NOT `mail.hostinger.com`)
2. Try the alternative port/encryption combination
3. Check if your network/firewall allows SMTP ports

### Emails Not Being Delivered

**Possible causes:**
- DNS not fully propagated
- SPF/DKIM records missing

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS changes to propagate
2. Check Hostinger documentation for email DNS records
3. Verify domain settings in Hostinger control panel

## Important Notes

âœ… **Username is ALWAYS your full email address** (`info@prepskul.com`)  
âœ… **Password is the password for your email account** (NOT your hPanel password)  
âœ… **Use TLS on port 587** (most reliable for most hosts)  
âœ… **Set Reply-To** to the same address for proper replies
