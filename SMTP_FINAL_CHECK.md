# âœ… FINAL CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING

## Your Configuration is CORRECT âœ…

Everything looks good:
- âœ… Host: smtp.hostinger.com
- âœ… Port: 465 (requires SSL)
- âœ… Username: info@prepskul.com  
- âœ… Password: Prepskul123#
- âœ… Minimum interval: 60 seconds

## IMPORTANT: Port 465

**Port 465 uses SSL encryption automatically in Supabase**

Supabase should detect port 465 and use SSL without you needing to select it.

## What to Check

Look for **ONE more field** before submitting:

### "Sender Name" or "From Name" or "Display Name"
- If you see this field, set it to: `PrepSkul`
- This ensures emails show "From: PrepSkul" (not "Supabase Auth")
- It might be on this page or in the Email Templates section

## SUBMIT NOW! ðŸš€

Click **"Save changes"** and you're done!

## After Submitting

1. Send a test email immediately
2. Check your inbox within 1-2 minutes  
3. Look for: "From: PrepSkul info@prepskul.com"
4. If you see this, you're SUCCESSFUL! ðŸŽ‰

## If It Fails

Just try port 587 instead:
```
Port: 587
Encryption: STARTTLS
```

But chances are 99% it will work with port 465!
