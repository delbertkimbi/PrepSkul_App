# Quick Answer: Should You Submit?

## 🟢 YES! Go Ahead and Submit

Your SMTP configuration looks correct:
```
✅ Host: smtp.hostinger.com
✅ Port: 465
✅ Username: info@prepskul.com
✅ Password: Prepskul123#
✅ Minimum interval: 60 seconds
```

## ⚠️ One Important Check

**Port 465 requires SSL encryption (not STARTTLS)**

Supabase should auto-detect this, but if there's an encryption dropdown:
- Select **SSL** (for port 465)
- NOT **STARTTLS** (that's for port 587)

## 🔍 Before You Click "Save Changes"

Look for these additional fields (they might be on the same page or in a different section):

1. **Sender Name** or **From Name**
   - Set to: `PrepSkul`
   - This makes emails show "From: PrepSkul" instead of "From: Supabase Auth"

2. **Reply-To** (optional)
   - Set to: `info@prepskul.com`
   - Ensures replies come to your business email

**Note:** These fields might be:
- On the same page, scroll down
- In the "Email Templates" section
- In an "Advanced" or "Configure" dropdown
- Auto-set based on your username

## ✅ After You Submit

1. **Immediately click "Send Test Email"** (if available)
2. **Check your inbox** within 1-2 minutes
3. **Verify** the sender shows as "PrepSkul"
4. **Check spam folder** if email doesn't arrive

## 🚨 If It Doesn't Work

Try port 587 with STARTTLS instead:
```
Host: smtp.hostinger.com
Port: 587
Encryption: STARTTLS
Username: info@prepskul.com
Password: Prepskul123#
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Your configuration is CORRECT. Go ahead and submit!** 🚀

Most likely outcome: It will work perfectly, and you'll see "PrepSkul" as the sender name automatically.

If not, we'll troubleshoot together. But you're set up correctly!
